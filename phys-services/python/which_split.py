    """
    Event substream selection utility. It's presented as a "pypick", that is, you can
    do boolean expressions with the function itself (as opposed to its return value):

    If = (which_split('foo') | which_split('bar')) & pypick(lambda f: 'somepulses' in f)

    Note that you should use the symbolic logic operators (&=and, |=or, ^=xor, ~=invert),
    because the English versions have a slightly different scope and in this case that
    actually matters, using the English versions will sometimes result in undesired
    surprising behavior.
