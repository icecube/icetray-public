DISCLAIMER
==========

This collection of ice tables is merely provided as a convenience for writing
icetray python scripts, for example for testing and for studying properties of
reconstruction algorithms.

For an authoritive source of these and other ice models, please check: 

http://wiki.icecube.wisc.edu/index.php/Ice_tables_for_photonics

and related wiki pages, and consult with ice experts, in particular
with Kurt Woschnagg and Dmitry Chirkin.

Some of these ice models are outdated, and only kept for historical reasons and
because some of the older scripts and testing code still uses these older
models. For instance, it does not make sense to use an ice model in AMANDA
coordinates for IceCube data.

The list is not complete, in particular the models with <cos theta>=0.94 are
not yet included.

The tables in this directory are all formatted as specified in this wiki page:

DESCRIPTION OF THE AVAILABLE TABLES
===================================

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: Ice_table.aha.i3coords.cos080.17may2007.txt
Ice model: AHA, <cos theta>=0.8
Range: -855.4m ... +854.6m
Coordinate system: IceCube

The AHA model, used for many AMANDA and early icecube analyses.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: Ice_table.wham.i3coords.cos080.11jul2011.txt
Ice model: WHAM!, <cos theta>=0.8
Range: -861.93m ... +848.07m
Coordinate system: IceCube

Successor of AHA, based on new analysis and new data, presented first in 2010,
updated in 2011. Part of the newer simulations are performed with 
this ice model. ("new" relative to January 20, 2012)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: Ice_table.spice.i3coords.cos080.10feb2010.txt
Ice model: SPICE1, <cos theta>=0.8
Range: -855.4m ... +854.6m
Coordinate system: IceCube

The SPICE1 model is the first version (out of many) of Dima Chirkin's new ice model.
Dima actually uses a different file format to specify his SPICE ice model; this model
is a translation of Dima's format into Kurt's ice table format. All disclaimers apply
here in full force.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: Ice_table.mie.i3coords.cos090.08Apr2011.txt
Ice model: SPICE MIE, <cos theta>=0.9
Range: -855.4m ... +854.6m
Coordinate system: IceCube

The SPICE MIE model is the most recent version (out of many) of Dima Chirkin's new ice model.
Dima actually uses a different file format to specify his SPICE ice model; this model
is a translation of Dima's format into Kurt's ice table format. All disclaimers apply
here in full force. In particular the SPICE MIE model features tilted ice layers, while the
ice table format does not support tilted layers, so this table only gives the model for 
the central axis (x=y=0) of the detector.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: homo_ice.dat
Ice model: homogeneous ice
Range: -1000m ... +1000m
Coordinate system: any (AMANDA or IceCube)

This is homogeneous ice, but it does not provide the same but not the same
parameters as the standard H2 Pandel configuration in ipdf/lilliput. Could be
useful for reconstruction studies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: ice_table_2000.dat
Ice model: Millennium
Range: -670m ... +630m
Coordinate system: AMANDA

Mostly used for the AMANDA analyses in 2000-2005. Should not be used anymore
for any serious purpose.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filename: iceProperties.dat
Ice model: unknown (pre-millennium?)
Range: -600m ... +630m
Coordinate system: AMANDA

This ice model has been in phys-services since ages. If someone recognizes
which model it is, then please mention it here. It's used by several test
scripts in muon-llh-reco, ipdf and phys-services.
