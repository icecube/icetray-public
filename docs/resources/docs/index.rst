Documentation
=============

This page describes provides an overview of the IceTray documentation system.
Because of IceTray's modular design and the fact that documentation is provided
from number of different sources it can be quite complicated.
The is system uses `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to translate these
different sources into html.
``sphinx`` was originally developed to be the documentation system for python, but
has developed support for many languages.
There are four main sources for documentation:

* restructured text (``rst``) which for writing high level descriptions of the code
* sphinx python  which automatically documents python code based on the code and
  provided comments
* doxygen which parses c and c++ code and automatically produces documentation
  and creates documentation based on the code and provided comments
* ``icetray-inspect`` which analyses IceTray interfaces such as IceTray modules,
  service factories and ``tableio`` readers.

``sphinx`` then combines these into a single group of html files.
Cross references are possible between each of these groups of sources.

Building the docs
=================

Building the entire docs can take quite some time, once a day the
`IceTray buildbot <http://builds.icecube.wisc.edu/>`_ will rebuild the entire
document for all currently used projects and post it at
`<http://software.icecube.wisc.edu/documentation/>`_.
However, it is often necessary to build the docs yourself.
The docs are build with a python script called ``docs-build`` which will be
available in your path if you are in an IceTray environment.
If run without any arguments the entire document will be build which will take
some time.
Usually when writing documentation you will only want to see the docs for one or
two projects this can be accomplished with:

.. code:: shell

   # docs-build --projects astro bayesian-priors --open

This will only build two projects: astro and baysian-priors.
In addition, the ``--open`` option will open the html file for you in the browser
as soon as the build is complete.
Other wise you will have to find the docs yourself in the directory they are
written to ``$I3_BUILD/docs/build/html/``.

Another useful option is the ``-j`` option which will specify how many parallel
process to run analogously to the ``-j`` option passed to ``make``.
For example if your machine has eight processors you should run ``docs-build -j8``
to run with eight concurrent processes.

Other steps to speed up the build are to skip the sources you are not currently
interested: ``--no-general-docs`` will skip the documents which are not associated
with any project such as the "Basic Info" and "Of General Interest" sections
of the main page. ``--no-project-docs`` will skip the build of project documents
found in each projects ``resources/docs``, ``--no-python`` will skip building the
python docs, ``--no-doxygen`` will prevent reading c/c++ docs with doxygen,
``--no-cpp`` will skip reading the docs generated by doxygen into the documentation and ``--no-inspect`` will skip examining the IceTray modules to document their interfaces. 
For a complete list of options available run ``docs-build --help``.

Writing Documentation
=====================

Project Docs
------------

Each project in ``$I3_SRC`` should contain a ``docs`` directory which will
contain the primary documentation for that project. These docs should serve an
an overview for the project and other information not directly linked to
specific pieces of code. This documentation is written in a format called
ReStructuredText or (``rst``) which is a fairly easy format to learn.
An introduction to ``rst`` can be found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_.

A really handy resource for writing ``rst`` is `<http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_
which will allow you to type in ``rst`` and get immediate feedback as to
weather you are properly formatting the document. Unfortunately, cross references
will show up as errors. Many editors also have support for ``rst``: emacs support
can be found `here <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html>`_.
vim has support with `riv <https://github.com/Rykka/riv.vim>`_.
