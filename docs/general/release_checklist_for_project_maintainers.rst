Release Checklist for Project Maintainers
=========================================

The purpose of this checklist is to give project maintainers some guidance as to what
they should be checking before each release.

Expect Improvement
------------------
The expectations are that releases should either improve or remain unchanged. Therefore
strict bitwise backward compatibility is not a requirement. It's OK for algorithms to change,
if the change is an improvement.  This applies to default configurations (i.e. module/segment
parameters).  If a project owner feels a new set of parameters are better and should be
used in production (or in general) the default values of the module or tray segment should
change to reflect that.  Note: These changes should be clearly indicated in the release notes.

Checklist
---------
Project maintainers are responsible for **every** aspect of their project.  

Below are some things to check :

  * **Release Notes** : Ensure the RELEASE_NOTES are up to date and accurate.  Check the 'svn log' and make sure there isn't any commit to your project to don't understand or agree with.
  * **Documentation** 

    - Ensure your project's documentation is *accurate and up to date*. If you see where documentation can easily be improved, please take the time to do it.  
    - Ensure your project's documentation is *complete*.  If something's going to take a little more time, please create a ticket for yourself as a reminder to address it before the next code sprint.

  * **Example Scripts** : Ensure your project's example scripts run.
  * **Tickets** : Are there any critical tickets still open?  If there are non-critical tickets still open, please add a comment to the ticket as to why you're not addressing this now and push the milestone.
  * **Build** : Ensure your project builds without warnings.
  * **Test Coverage** : CI systems give a false sense of security for projects with low test coverage.
    - Strive for greater than 90% line coverage.
    - Strive for close to 100% function coverage.
