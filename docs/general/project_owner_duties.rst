Responsibilities of Project Maintainers
=======================================

The purpose of this is to give project maintainers some guidance as to what
is expected of them, when it comes to project maintenance.

Project maintainers are responsible for **every** aspect of their project.

They should:

#. Plan to attend every code sprint.
#. Commit to resolving tickets in a timely manner.
#. Ensure documentation is correct and up to date.
#. Ensure example scripts run out of the box.
#. Write good release notes before each release.
