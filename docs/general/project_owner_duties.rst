Responsibilities of Project Maintainers
=======================================

The purpose of this is to give project maintainers some guidance as to what
is expected of them, when it comes to project maintenance.

Project maintainers are responsible for **every** aspect of their project.  

They should:
1. Plan to attend every code sprint.
2. Commit to resolving tickets in a timely manner.
3. Ensure documentation is correct and up to date.
4. Ensure example scripts run out of the box.
5. Write good release notes before each release.
