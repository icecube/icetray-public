IceTray Software Policy
=======================

Release Policy
--------------

Release Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tests: All tests pass on all supported platforms.
Open Tickets: All blockers must be resolved or downgraded.

With each IceTray release we should consider a cvmfs and test-data release.

Candidate vs. Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Candidates are meant for **testing** only.
- Candidates have short lifetimes and **will be deleted** after the release.
- Samples produced or processed with candidates **will be deleted**.
- Samples produced or processed with candidates **should not** be used for
  analysis.

Release Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0) Make a release candidate.
1) Ensure all tests pass on all supported platforms.
2) Ensure there are no blocking tickets.
3) Push any open non-blocking tickets to the next milestone.
4) Update release notes.

New Projects
------------

All new production projects included in IceTray, must pass a code review. (See :ref:`icecube-code-reviews`)

New Dependencies
----------------

All new third-party dependencies must be discussed on a phone call. (See :ref:`icecube-code-reviews`)
