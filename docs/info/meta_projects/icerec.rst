Icerec
######

The icerec meta-project contians all the processing and reconstruction
projects nescessary for the online filter as well as the offline processing.
In order for a reconstruction to be included in processing if must first
be added to icerec. Major parts of **icerec**
are hit/pulse extraction and cleaning, fast (first guess)
reconstruction methods that will operate on Pole and elaborate
(Likelihood) algorithms to work offline.
**icerec** also inherits projects from the :doc:`offline software <offline_software>`
meta-project.

In order for a new project included in **icerec**, It first must be thoroughly
:doc:`documented </projects/cmake/documentation>`,
:doc:`code reviewed </general/code_reviews>`, and have appropiate
:doc:`unit tests </projects/cmake/i3test>`.
Further tests will encompass physics comparisons with simulated and real data.
