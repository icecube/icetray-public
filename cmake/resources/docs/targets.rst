Targets
=======

Workspace level
---------------

As the name suggests, workspace-level targets are available from the
workspace directory. These are a superset of the targets available in
project directories. The workspace-only targets perform higher level
tasks like creating projects and generating environment scripts. As
the table below explains, project-level targets invoked in the
workspace are forwarded to a child make processes in each project
directory.

Project level targets include several standard targets like *clean*
and *all*, as well as whatever targets are created by calling 
cmake macros described in :ref:`macroreference` and in the 
standard cmake documentation.
