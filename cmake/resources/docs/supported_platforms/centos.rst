Red Hat Variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CentOS
""""""

CentOS 7/8 is not yet recommended for desktop and laptop use.  Your mileage may vary.
Please report successes and failures to the #software channel.

Minimal Install
...............

Need to enable PowerTools to get boost-python3-devel.  Note that the stock
cmake version 3.11 doesn't detect python 3.6, so it's currently recommended
to install the lastest version of cmake (https://cmake.org/install/).


.. container:: wrapped-code

    dnf install epel-release
    dnf config-manager --enable epel
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools

    yum install zlib-devel python39-devel
    boost-devel boost-system boost-thread boost-date-time
    boost-filesystem boost-program-options boost-regex boost-iostreams
    boost-python3-devel
    gsl-devel bzip2-devel cfitsio-devel
