Do Not Use MacPorts
...................

MacPorts (and Fink, and Homebrew, etc) can cause all sorts of
mismatched library issues. The IceCube software is designed for and
tested against Apple OS X systems without 3rd party package
managers. They cause major headaches and (when it comes to IceCube)
are more trouble than they are worth.

But I Want To Pull Out My Hair, Get An Ulcer, Break My Chair And Possibly Kick A Puppy
......................................................................................

If you do use a 3rd party package manager, and something breaks, you
will be directed to the above paragaph and told to remove it. That
being said, if you want to continue, then take caution.  After you
have "source env.sh", your $PATH variable is updated so that
$I3_PORTS/bin is first. So:

* Always explicitly run $I3_PORTS/bin/port (never let it come from
  your path).

* Never "su" or "sudo" from an xterm where you have "source env.sh",
  as this altered path might be kept and cause conflicts when you
  think you are running a "system" port command.  Start a new xterm
  instead.

* A system Macports install for things like subversion is not needed
  in 10.5/Leopard, since subversion is now supplied by the OS.

Java
""""

As of February  8, 2011, the offline-software meta-project does not
use Java, and related warnings can be safely ignored.

However, the simulation meta-project requires Java. In order for
JAVA_HOME to be set correctly, export using the following command
(bash/sh version)::

  export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home

which you can set in your ``.bashrc``.

Additionally, as of *Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3 and 10.5 Update
8* Apple no longer ships the Java Native Interface (JNI) headers and
libraries as part of its Java package. The JNI files are included in a
separate Developer package. This package can be installed by doing the
following:

1) Go to http://connect.apple.com/
2) Sign with or create an "Apple Developer ID"
3) Once signed in, in the "Download" sidebar to the right, click "Java"
4) Select the appropriate developer package that matches your OS and Java Update versions.
5) Install the .dmg/.pkg as normal

If you still have problems detecting Java/JNI correctly, try replacing
your ``cmake/tools/jni.cmake`` file with the most current version,
which can always be found here_.

There is a script at
http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/icetray-dist/distros/ScientificSL.sh
that will install the necessary packages.

After installing these packages, run "easy_install -U Sphinx" to install
Python Sphinx for using the documentation system.

There is a script at

Ubuntu or Debian
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a script at
http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/icetray-dist/distros/Ubuntu.sh
that will install the necessary packages.

To install further packages (emacs and so forth), the easiest thing to
do is use the "Synaptic Package Manager", which you can start from menu
``System --> Administration``. 

In order for JAVA_HOME to be set correctly, export using the following
command (bash/sh version)::

  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun

which you can set in your ``.bashrc``.


Karmic Koala
""""""""""""

Support is in as of Nov 20, 2009 for Karmic Koala, with a caveat: The
current ``i3-tools-v3`` 'metatool' requires ``root_5.20.00``... but
that version of root won't build on karmic.  However ``root_5.24.00b``
*will*.  So install ``i3-tools-v3-karmic``, which uses this updated
root, instead.
  
If you are using metaprojects which are already released as of Nov 20
2009 (e.g. those numbered less than 09-11-00) you will also need to
modify the root detection in the build system; replace
``$I3_SRC/cmake/tools/root.cmake`` with a more recent version that
understands ``5.24.00b``, that is, one that contains the following
code::

    elseif(IS_DIRECTORY ${I3_PORTS}/root-v5.24.00b)
      set(ROOT_VERSION "5.24.00b")

FreeBSD
"""""""

Offline software is supported on FreeBSD 8 and newer. Versions of ROOT
earlier than 5.30 will not build on 64-bit FreeBSD hosts, so you may need
to pass -DUSE_ROOT to cmake while building.
