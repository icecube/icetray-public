Details by Platform
===================

With limited manpower and resources it's not possible to test and
support all platforms.  When choosing a platform for your laptop,
desktop, or institution cluster, use common sense and you should be
safe.  You'd be doing yourself a favor by choosing one of the
officially suppported platforms tested on the buildbots_.

Variants should also generally work without too much trouble. For
instance, you should be fine using a version of Linux Mint that is in
parity with a tested version of Ubuntu Linux.

Officially Supported Platforms
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Scientific Linux : 7 and 6
* Ubuntu : 16.04 and 14.04
* Mac OS X : 10.11 and 10.10
* openSUSE : 13.2 (in lieu of SUSE Enterprise Linux)

If you'd like a platform added to the list please generate a 
`ticket <http://code.icecube.wisc.edu/projects/icecube/newticket>`_
for the request.  Note that priority will be given to clusters 
and grids.  Support for platforms that very few collaborators use
will be considered semi-official.  Meaning, we won't dedicate a
bot for that platform, but we will accept any patches that make
our software work for you.  Please understand that we require
all developers submit commits that keep the buildbots green.
Extending this list to accomodate a few collaborators puts an 
undue burden on the entire development team.
