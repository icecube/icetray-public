# - Try to find OpenCL
# This module tries to find an OpenCL implementation on your system. It supports
# AMD / ATI, Apple and NVIDIA implementations, but should work, too.
#
# Once done this will define
#  OPENCL_FOUND        - system has OpenCL
#  OPENCL_INCLUDE_DIRS  - the OpenCL include directory
#  OPENCL_LIBRARIES    - link these to use OpenCL

# we don't use the tooldef() macro, so we have to fudge pretty-printing
