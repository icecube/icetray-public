IceCube C++ Coding Standards
============================

.. image:: brazil.jpg

This is the third draft of the IceCube C++ Coding Standards. The first
draft was provided by Thomas Burgess, the second by Erik Blaufuss.  The
third is being expanded by the community.

Introduction
------------

These are coding standards and recommendations for developers of
IceCube software in C++ and Python.  There is a companion document for
:ref:`library_standards`.

This document refers primarily to offline software (including IceTray,
Dataclasses, Simulation and the event viewer).  Users are encouraged
to write their own private software to these standards, to make future
code maintence and the adoption of private code for production use
easier.

Python Coding Standards
-----------------------

Python coding standards follow the recommendations set forth in `PEP
0008 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. Where they cause
conflict, the C++ coding standards outlined below, take precedence.

C Coding Standards
------------------

The use of pure C is strongly discouraged.  This is not a statement about
the language, it's simply a choice we have to make based on the limited
resources available.  We have one compiled language (C++) and one
interpreted (Python) that covers everything we need.  We strive to ensure
that all production code is accessible to every member. C++ is no longer
"C with classes" but arguably a separate language.  At the very least,
coding styles differ greatly between the two communities and we have our
hands full with the two official languages we already have.

Should you find it necessary to write something in pure C, we ask that
you follow the Linux kernel coding style.

C++ Coding Standards
--------------------

Good coding standards offer many interrelated advantages:

* *Improved code quality:* Encouranging developers to do the
  right things in a consistent way directly works to improve software
  quality and maintainability.
* *Faster development:* Developers dont need to always make
  decisions starting from first principles.
* *Better Teamwork:* They help reduce needless debates on
  inconsequential issues and make it easier for teammates to read and
  maintain each other's code.
* *Uniformity in the right dimension:* This frees developers
  to be creative in directions that matter.

Code reviews will make constant reference to *C++ Coding Standards* [#]_, by Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu.  If you submit code that
gets reviewed, you should have access to a copy: reviewers will refer
to the book, and everybody will save time if you can read the full
details/explanations yourself.

This document borrows pieces from the book's structure, and you will find direct
quotes from the book throughout (like the opening paragraph of this
section).  Each of the headings below corresponds to a several-page
long chapter in the book, where one can find Sutter's treatment, so
look there for more information.  Icecube-specific elaborations,
modifications, and excerpts from code reviews are found here.  You are
*not* expected to memorize them or to submit code in full compliance
with every single rule, as these are goals to strive for, and many are
achievably only in degree.  Do your best, and we will refer to this
document in reviews.
