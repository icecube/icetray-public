About this documentation
========================

These docs were generated with Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

A version of sphinx > 0.4.3 is required.  This means that as of this
writing, the trunk is required.     The easiest way to install this 
version is::

   easy_install -U Sphinx

Then see :ref:`workspace-targets` for information on building them.

Each project whose :ref:`i3_project() <i3_project>` macro invocation specifies a
:ref:`DOCS_DIR <DOCS_DIR>` will be linked to above.
