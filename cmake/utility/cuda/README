This directory contains an SVN export of
https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/findcuda/tags/2.0/CMake/cuda.

These files allow CMake versions less than 2.8.0 to find the CUDA SDK
and utilities in order for the GPU accelerated version of 'ppc' to
compile.

This directory will go away, since CMake 2.8.0 has been out since 2009.
