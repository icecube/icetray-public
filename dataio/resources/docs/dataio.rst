IceTray I/O
===========

The dataio modules I3Writer, I3MultiWriter and I3Reader support on-the-fly
compression and exclusion of various frame items via regular expressions. 
The .i3 file browser 'dataio-shovel' is a handy utility. There is also
a python variant 'dataio-pyshovel' which can launch an ipython session
from the active frame.

Reading in .i3 files from the data warehouse
--------------------------------------------

Make sure you order the files sent to the I3Reader so that the proper GCD frames are supplied prior to P frames.

If any of the following apply, you may need to follow I3Reader with appropriate
source services and the module I3MetaSynth:

* Using the database as a source of Geometry, Calibration, DetectorStatus
* This includes decoding RAW data that does not contains GCD frame.
* Using a database service to replace the G, C and/or D frames in a existing .i3 file.

Basically, anytime you are getting information from other sources that
a single stream of i3 files....

Usage
^^^^^

Usage is straightforward.  Available parameters are listed below (from
icetray-inspect dataio)::
 
   I3Reader
    Filename (string)
      Description :  Filename to read.  Use either this or Filenamelist, not both.
      Default     :  ""
  
    FilenameList (vector<string>)
      Description :  List of files to read, *IN SORTED ORDER*
      Default     :  []
  
    SkipKeys (vector<string>)
      Description :  Don't load frame objects with these keys
      Default     :  []
  

An example python script::

   #!/usr/bin/env python
   import os
   import sys
   
   from I3Tray import *
   from icecube import dataclasses, dataio
   
   tray = I3Tray()
   tray.AddModule("I3Reader","reader",
      filename="pass1.i3")
   tray.AddModule("Dump","dump")
   tray.AddModule("TrashCan", "the can");
   
   tray.Execute()
   tray.Finish()
  

Compression
^^^^^^^^^^^

The writers will automatically compress if you specify a filename that ends in .gz or .bz2. This::

  tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "write",
                 filename="mystuff.i3.gz")                                                 

that will get you run-of-the-mill gzip compression. With CompressionLevel you can specify::

   Compression Level  -  Meaning
  
              0       -  no compression. Or just specify a filename that doesn't end in .gz
  
              1       -  fastest
              6       -  default (best combination of compression and speed
              9       -  best compression
  
 
so this:: 

 tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "write",
     filename="mystuff.i3.gz")                                                                             

should get you the same result as just writing to disk and then gzipping, and this::

 tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "write",
                filename="mystuff.i3.gz",
                compressionlevel=9)

will compress better at the cost of speed. The I3Reader will recognize
if the file ends in .gz and turn on decompression if necessary::

 tray.AddModule("I3Reader", "reader",
                filename="mystuff.i3.gz")                                                  

It does not need to know what the compression level of the input file is. In
addition, I3Reader will transparently read gzip, bzip2, or xz-compressed .i3
files, or .i3 files inside of compressed tar archives like the PFFilt files 
packaged and transferred over the satellite link by JADE. Any format that
libarchive_ supports can be read.

.. _libarchive: http://www.libarchive.org

The I3Writer will automatically compress if you specify a filename
that ends in .gz::

  tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "write",
                 filename="mystuff.i3.gz")

that will get you run-of-the-mill gzip compression.  With
'CompressionLevel' you can specify the usual::

 0 == no compression
 1 == fastest
 6 == default
 9 == best compression

so this::

 tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "write",
                filename="mystuff.i3.gz")

should get you the same result as just writing to disk and then
gzipping.

The I3Reader will just recognize if the file ends in .gz and turn on
decompression if necessary::

 tray.AddModule("I3Reader", "reader",
                 filename="mystuff.i3.gz")

not much to explain there.

Reading from and writing to remote locations (staging)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes the files you want to read are not available on your local
filesystem. For example, if you're running on a random node on the Open Science
Grid, you will not have direct access to the /data/sim and /data/exp
filesystems in Madison. For such situations, dataio has built-in support for
"staging" files in and out of local storage. This support is activated by
replacing the `"I3Reader"` module with the `dataio.I3Reader` tray segment. For
example, to read files via GridFTP, use the following snippet::
	
	from icecube import icetray, dataio
	tray.Add(dataio.I3Reader, filenamelist=['gsipftp://gridftp.icecube.wisc.edu/data/sim/IceCube/2010/filtered/level3-cscd/CORSIKA-in-ice/9493/92000-92999/Level3_IC79_corsika.009493.092110.i3.bz2 '])

The segment dataio.I3Reader is equivalent to::
	
	tray.context['I3FileStager'] = dataio.get_stagers()
	tray.AddModule('I3Reader', **kwargs)

Behind the scenes the stager will recognize supported URL schemes (currently
file:// http://, ftp://, gsiftp://, and scp://), download the file to a local
directory, and provide the reader with a local filename to read instead. As
soon as the file is no longer needed, it will be automatically deleted. The
inverse operation works for writing as well. If the staging mechanism has been
set up (using either of the snippets above), then I3Writer will also recognize
URL schemes, write the output to a temporary file, and upload it to the
destination when the file is closed. For example, the following snippet will
write an .i3 file to my /data/user directory in Madison from anywhere in the
world::
	
	tray.Add('I3Writer', filename='gsiftp://gridftp-users.icecube.wisc.edu/data/user/jvansanten/foo.i3.bz2')

Plain POSIX path names, e.g. "/data/user/jvansanten/foo.i3.bz," will not be
staged, but instead read directly. The :py:func:`hdfwriter.I3HDFWriter` and
:py:func:`rootwriter.I3ROOTWriter` segments use the same staging mechanism.
Currently, the following stager classes are implemented:

.. py:module:: icecube.dataio.I3FileStagerFile

.. autoclass:: I3FileStagerFile

.. autoclass:: GridFTPStager

.. autoclass:: SCPStager

SkipKeys
^^^^^^^^

You can specify that the reader not read (or the writer not write)
certain keys (that is, the names they're stored under) with SkipKeys,
which now takes, instead of a space-separated list of strings, a
vector of perl-style regular expressions.

so given a frame that looks like this::

 Frame: 5/8

This::

 tray.AddModule("I3Writer", "writer",
                filename="mystuff.i3.gz",
                skipkeys=["F2kHitSel_DummyTrig.*"])

Will skip all the f2k dummy triggers.

This::

    skipkeys = ["F2kTrack.*HitSel", ".*Bryant"]

Will skip all the f2ktrack hit selection thingys, and anything that
ends with "Bryant".  This::

    skipkeys = ["F2kTrack.*HitSel", ".*Bryant"]

But note the dot-star in there, these are perl-style regular
expressions, not the filesystem-globbing stuff that you use in your
shell when doing things like 'ls *.f2k'.  To match anything once,
(like ? in the shell) use a dot.  To match anything any number of
times, use dot-star, like F2k.* 

The syntax is a little different, and they can be both absurdly
powerful and, well, simply absurd, if you geek out on them::

    skipkeys = ["F2kTrack\d*(([02468]Params)|([13579]HitSel))"]

This, for instance, removes the Params from even numbered tracks and
HitSels from odd-numbered tracks.  This is the reason for vectors of
regular expressions.  If you just want to type out every single track
name, you certainly can::

     skipkeys =  ["DrivingTime",
                  "F2kEventHeader",          
                  "F2kHitSel_DummyTrig5",

                  "F2kHitSel_FinalHitSel",   
                  "F2kHitSel_HitSel0",       
                  "F2kHitSel_HitSel1",       
                  "F2kHitSel_HitSel2",       
                  "F2kMCPrimaryTrack00",     
                  "F2kMCTracks",             
                  "F2kMuonDAQ",              
                  "F2k_all_the_others_etc"
                  "F2kMuonDAQ_uncalib",      
                  "F2kSoftwareTriggerFlags", 
                  "F2kTrack00",              
                  "F2kTrack00HitSel",        
                  "F2kTrack11Params",        
                  "F2kTrack12",              
                  "F2kTrack12HitSel",        
                  "F2kTrack12Params",        
                  "F2kTrack13",              
                  "F2kTrack13HitSel",        
                  "F2kTrack13Params",        
                  "F2kTriggers"]

will work too.

Splitting off the Geometry, Calibration, and DetectorStatus 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is useful in sim production.  You use two writers, an I3Writer
for geometry, calibration and detector status, and an I3MultiWriter
for the physics::

  tray.AddModule("I3Writer","gcdwriter",
                 filename="split.gcd.i3",
                 streams=["Geometry", "Calibration", "DetectorStatus"])
 
  tray.AddModule("I3MultiWriter","physwriter",
                 filename="split.physics.%04u.i3",
                 streams=["Physics"],
                 sizelimit=10**5)

The 'streams' parameter specifies to each writer which streams they
should react to.  The I3TrayInfo frames get written to all files.  The
names of the streams are case-sensitive.


The dataio-shovel 
-----------------

The dataio-shovel is a .i3 file browser utility. It has interactive
help and can be handy to identify what is inside a .i3 file. Try it
out. Here comes the screenshot:

.. image:: Dataio_shovel.gif

The bottom part of the display shows a tape-like representation of the
icecube data stream. The G, C, D, Q, and P represent Geometry,
Calibration, DetectorStatus, DAQ, and Physics, respectively. The bar in the
middle is the location of the tape read head. On the top half are what
is currently under the read head: a 'frame'. Each row is one data
item. On the left is the 'key' the object is stored under, in the
middle is the type of the object (with typedefs stripped away), on the
right is the on-disk size of the object in bytes.

The up-down arrows select frame items and the 'x' key will display
that item in XML. The 'c' key will show the configuration of the tray
that generated the datafile, including all module parameters, svn
information, time of run, hostname, compiler and root versions, and
operating system type. Full help is available in the shovel itself.


The dataio-pyshovel
-------------------

The dataio-pyshovel is a rewrite of dataio-shovel in python instead
of C++.  This allows I3RecoPulseMapMasks and similar objects to be
translated to human-readible things, and enables the 'o' or 'enter'
keys to provide a pretty printout of objects.

The other headline feature is the ability to drop into ipython while
keeping the frame and its frame objects as local variables.  This
allows very easy in-depth examination of frame objects.

Other minor changes include only reading partially through a file and
lazy loading the rest to allow prompt viewing of the first few frames.


Reading multiple files
----------------------

To read multiple files use the parameter 'FilenameList'.  To generate
the list of files from a directory, you might find the python
<code>glob()</code> function convenient::

 from glob import glob
 
 file_list = glob("/my/data/\*.i3.gz")
 tray.AddModule("I3Reader", "reader",
                 FilenameList=file_list)

as usual with vector<string> parameters, you can pass an array
literal::

 tray.AddModule("I3Reader", "reader",
                 FilenameList=["file1.i3.gz", "file2.i3.gz", file3.i3.gz"])


The files will be read in order.  When then end of one file is
reached, the next will be opened.

You may mix compressed (.i3.gz) and noncompressed (.i3) files in any order.

If you specify both a 'Filename' and a 'FilenameList' the reader
service will log_fatal() complaining that the configuration is
ambiguous and tell you to use one or the other.

Reading Geometry/Calibration/Status from a separate file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simulation runs have the Geometry, Calibration, and Detector Status
frames in a separate file from the physics.  You want to read this GCD
file first, and then the rest of them in order.

python's glob() function can generate the list of physics files for
you.  Assuming the GCD is in GCD_0340.i3.gz and the associated physics
frames are in files physics_0340.00001.i3.gz through, say,
physics_0340.00999.i3.gz::


  from glob import glob 

  physics = glob("physics_0340.*.i3.gz")    # glob() the list of files from the disk

  physics.sort()                            # sort() them (they probably wont glob in alphabetical order)  

  tray.AddModule("I3Reader", "reader",
                  FilenameList=["GCD_0340.i3.gz"]+physics)


Writing Multiple Files
----------------------

The module I3MultiWriter will split the output into multiple data
files.  The **filename** argument is actually a printf() type
string, not a plain filename.  This string must contain a %u
formatting character, which will be replaced with the index of the
file in the series written.  For instance::

   tray.AddModule("I3MultiWriter", "writer",
                  Filename="foo/myfile-%u.i3.gz",
                  SizeLimit=10**6)  # Files of 1MB size: double-star is the exponent operator

will cause the I3MultiWriter to write files foo/myfile-0.i3.gz,
foo/myfile-1.i3.gz, foo/myfile-2.i3.gz, etc.

Probably you will want to specify something like ::

   foo/myfile-%04u.i3.gz

where 04 in ``%04u`` means that the index number of the file will be
left-padded with zeros to a width of 4::

   foo/myfile-0000.i3.gz
   foo/myfile-0001.i3.gz
   foo/myfile-0002.i3.gz

etc.  This is so that the files stay in generated order when listed
with *ls* or passed to the I3Reader via glob().

The other necessary parameter is **SizeLimit** which specifies, in
bytes, a soft limit on the size of each file.  This is not a hard
limit: a file will be closed and the next one opened after a frame
write causes the current file size to exceed this limit.  The files
written will typically exceed this size by the size of one half of one
frame.  One consequence of this behavior is that you can write
one-frame-per-file by specifying a SizeLimit of one byte.

There are some example python scripts using dataio in the
`resources/examples` directory.
