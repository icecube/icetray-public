=============

trunk
-----

* Add support for S-Frames in tableio

Dec. 20, 2019 Alex Olivas (aolivas@umd.edu)
-------------------------------------------
Combo Release V00-00-00

December 11, 2018, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------
Release V18-12-00

* trivial cleanups to tests and logging.

June 13, 2018, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
----------------------------------------------------
Release V18-06-00

* (r159919) latest version of pytables deprecates camelcase method names, switch to snakecase

November 15, 2017, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------
Release V17-11-00

* very minor cleanups

March 23, 2017, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------
Release V17-03-00

* (r1488889) Replace fractured but precise representation of event start and end in MJD with a double-precision value. This introduces a discretization of 300 ns that will increase to 600 ns in the next 100 years and 2500 in the next 1000. These are much smaller than the duration of a typical event, and can be ignored in coordinate calculations.

April 29, 2016, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------
Release V16-04-00

* Add a test that runs all the converters

March 21, 2016, don la dieu  (nega@icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------
Release V16-03-00

* (r143491/IceCube) correct conversion of derived types
* accept keys in any iterable container
* use ``std::is(nan|inf)``
* documentation updates

December 14, 2015, don la dieu  (nega@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------------
Release V15-12-00

* update tests
* remove dead code

August 31, 2015, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------------

Release V15-08-00 

* I3MCTree converter is back. It's still useless, but apparently it found its
  way into PINGU processing.
* Allow converters to accept subclasses of their handled types. This makes it
  possible to book I3LinearizedMCTree, a thing that was blocked for no good
  reason.

March 15, 2015, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------

Release V15-03-00 

* "weight" is now NPE and type uint64_t.

* No more converter for I3MCTree.  We'll start providing individual
  converters like "the primary"

November 20, 2014, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------

Release V14-11-00 - Bugfix release.

* Align all tables before closing

* Changed I3TableTranscriber to skip files containing no events 
  and throwing a warning instead of a fatal error.


August 11, 2011, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
------------------------------------------------------

* A converter for I3VectorTankKey
  -- Fabian Kislat

Bugfix:
