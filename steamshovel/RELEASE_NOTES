---------------------------------------------------
Release V16-03-00

General:

* Fixed a critical rare bug, which may have caused old
  frames to be shown if user first closed a file with the
  "close last file" action and then opened a new file

* Interactivity greatly improved while frames are still
  loaded from a file or filtered

* Editor widget for ShovelSlider now has usable size even
  on a Mac

* Reduced interaction delay when user tries to rotate the 3D
  view with the mouse on some systems with Intel graphics
  (dschultz)

* Performance improvement for SceneStepFunction and
  SceneLinterpFunction (replaced O(N) search with O(logN)),
  improves animation of very long events (jvansanten)

* Fixed detection of qtconsole in different versions of
  IPython

* --reset now also affects settings in FileService

* added code to create custom color maps (berghaus)

* Fixed an error in the rare case when RangeFinder
  would return an empty time interval 

* Fixed a C++11 compatibility issue with clang (cweaver)

User interface:

* New convenience feature: user may select a default
  I3Geometry object which is added to frames which do not
  already have an I3Geometry object (from frame mixing)

* Added "New Window" action to Window menu, which opens 
  a secondary main window showing the same frame; this
  allows for example to look at IceTop in one window,
  and at the same time at the deep detector in the other

* Added "Reload all" action to File menu

* Internal errors now cause the log viewer to be opened
  automatically (can be turned off in the preferences)

* Allow main window to become very small

Artist Particles:

* Scales Particle arrows as a function
  of their energy (can be turned off by setting "power" to 
  zero) (introduced by berghaus, modified by hdembinski)

* Angle of Cherenkov cone now adapts to particle speed

Artist IceTopViewer: 

* IceTopViewer gained two additional settings to display
  several particles simultaneously; this is useful to compare
  simulated shower and reconstructed shower, and the likes

* Fixed a bug where an event was not displayed at all if
  the I3Particle has NaN position or NaN direction

* Improved handling of plot margins, stopping axis labels
  from overlapping

* New option to show tanks without hits in the LDF plot

* Added support for new I3LaputopParams object

* Fixed a bug that prevented correct update of IceTopViewer
  on the very first frame in a file, if IceTopViewer is the
  active view on startup

Artist Position:

* Also handles collections of things with positions now,
  like I3VectorI3Position or I3VectorI3Particles

Documentation:

* Greatly expanded artist documentation of Bubbles and
  IceTopViewer

* Added more practical filter examples

------------------------------------------------------
Release V15-12-00

General:

* Revived the Map app

* Added Steamshovel LogViewer (accessible from menu Help) to 
  allow users of the Mac app to look at log messages

* Added GUI support for really long events (in time)

* Added more tests, in particular some tests that run a 
  steamshovel script and check its output

* Improved/updated docs (hdembinski, berghaus)

* Fixed a bug that occurs if steamshovel is called with several
  start-up scripts

* Fixed movie generation and support more encoders:
  ffmpeg, avconv, mencoder

User interface:

* Allow user to open more than one file at once

* Simplified online filter and made it easier to use

* Speed of event playback is now defined in absolute units,
  nanoseconds (in event) per second (real time), and can be set
  to precise values with a spin box, in addition to the slider

* Enhanced "Save Frame" dialog

  - added a field to specify individual frames or ranges to save
  - added check box to automatically "Save parents" or not
    ("parent" frames contain data needed in the current frame, 
    e.g. the Geometry frame is a parent of most other frames)

* Added option in configuration dialog to change the default
  font and font size used in Steamshovel

* RangeSettings are now edited with a new widget that combines 
  a slider and spin box (ShovelSlider), which makes it easier
  to set specific numeric values

* Delete key removes Artists in the Display tab

* IPython widget is now hidden by default, and only shown if the
  user activates it by pressing Ctrl+T (or through the menu);
  when it is active, it gets more space by replacing the tabbed
  widget in the top right corner

shovelio:

* shovelio uses central I3FrameMixer now, so that frame mixing 
  is consistent with icetray

* Fixed several bugs in shovelio and made it simpler

Artists:

* Added IceTopViewer, the first Aven... erm, WidgetArtist 

* Particles

  - added option to draw light fronts in Cherenhov blue (berghaus)
  - added option to draw secondary particles in color code,
    if particles are visualized from an I3MCTree
    (see documentation for meaning of colors) (berghaus)

* Bubbles

  - added option to draw hits as a kind of after glow, with
    user-defined decay length (david.schultz)
  - added option to use a secondary time window for coloring,
    instead of the central one (added to ChargeBubbles by berghaus,
    ported to Bubbles by hdembinski)

* Removed ChargedBubbles, its features were ported into Bubbles

* TextSummary supports D4R objects (hbretz)

* Detector

  - outline option is back with new edge detection algorithm

August 31, 2015, Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

New Artist:

* CoordinateSystem shows the arrows of the IceCube coordinate
  system; the location and length of arrows
  can be set in physical units (Python version based on C++
  code from M. Zoll)

Interface Changes:

* Artist classes were renamed and joined, focussing on the type
  of visualization rather than the association to an I3FrameObject
  (one Artist can typically visualize a range of related types)

* Mapping from old names of artists in Steamshovel to new names::

     Animated I3Particle,
        I3Postion marker -> Position
     Accumulated charge,
        Animated charge -> ChargeBubbles
     Accumulated MC charge,
        DOMLaunch start times,
        DOMs in list,
        DOMs in map,
        MCHit start times,
        MCPE start times -> Bubbles
     DOMLaunch time histogram -> DOMLaunchHistogram
     I3Geometry -> Detector
     I3EventHeader summary,
        I3FilterMask,
        I3MCTree summary,
        I3Particle summary,
        I3Time,
        Value label -> TextSummary 
     I3Particle,
        MCTree -> Particles
     I3Particle Uncertainty estimation -> ParticleUncertainty
     IceCube logo -> StaticImage
     Pulse plot -> RecoPulseWaveform
     Selected DOM label -> DOMLabel
     Uncalibrated waveform -> Waveform

* Descriptions of Artists in Steamshovel now agree with their
  class name, making it easier to talk about them and find them
  in the code

New Features:

* The Ice artist got an optional alternative dust layer visualization,
  enabled by the setting "3D dust" (feedback is appreciated)

* The color of DOMs can be customized in the Detector artist

* New cmd line option "--testmode" runs Steamshovel in a sandbox,
  without touching user settings (good for running test scripts)

* New option "Save frame" in the "File" menu saves the current frame into an i3 file

* Open files can be closed now

* PyArtists can draw arrows on the scene, using .addArrow(...)

* Filter interface allows to set arbitrary filters to pick out frames of interest

* Steamshovel got a lot faster by avoiding the unnecessary de-serialization of I3FrameObjects

* RangeFinder key is now saved as part of the session, solution to ticket 953

* RangeFinder finds keys for range computation in the frame much
  faster -> significant speed-up when switching frames

* New menu "Help" to show steamshovel's documentation

* New dialog to inform users about updates in the GUI that change work flow

* IO system re-written: users can start browsing immediately, frames are loaded in the background

* New dialog "Configuration" in "Windows" menu, to set cache sizes and frame keys to ignore

* New filter system: users can define Python filters to show only selected frames

* Steamshovel remembers window geometry

* Big speed boost when browsing frames through internal switch to string-based type identification

* Steamshovel compiles with Python-3.4 (some PyArtists may be broken, as Python-3.4 is not yet officially supported)

Bug Fixes:

* New artist "I3Particle(s)" fixes bugs in "MCTree" and "I3Particle" (tickets 939, 926)

* Corrected directions in AngleClock which sometimes displayed wrong angles

* Screenshots turned out too bright in some viewers, solved by making formerly fixed
  gamma correction an option in the "Screenshot" dialog
