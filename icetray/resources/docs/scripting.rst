Python scripting in IceTray
============================
Generally IceTray is controlled via a python script which sets up the needed 
modules and services, executes the Tray and cleans things up.  The
best illustration of this is a simple example::

 #!/usr/bin/env python
 #
 # Pass 2:
 
 from I3Tray import * 
 
 from os.path import expandvars
 
 import os
 import sys
 
 load("libicetray")
 load("libdataio")
 
 tray = I3Tray()
 
 tray.AddModule("I3Reader","reader", 
 		 Filename = "pass1.i3")

 tray.AddModule("Dump","dump")

 tray.AddModule("TrashCan","trash")
 
 tray.Execute()
 tray.Finish()

**TODO**  Flush out these docs more fully.

Configuring modules with vectors
--------------------------------
Python scripts can tersely configure
modules with vectors of ints, doubles, strings, and OMKeys.   
Project "examples" contains a script
"pass7_HelloConfiguration.py" which has an associated I3Module,
HelloConfiguration, which demonstrates the use of all this

In a python script, an individual OMKey is created like this:
OMKey(21,7).  you pass it to a module like you might expect::

 tray.AddModule("FryOM", "fry",
                OM = OMKey(3,3))


vectors of anythings are created by enclosing a comma separated
list of anythings in square-brackets::

 ["strings", "in", "a", "row"]

and you pass these to a module like this::

 tray.AddModule("ReverseTracks", "reverse",
                tracks = ["linefit", "dipolefit", "haystackfit"])

 tray.AddModule("OMSelect", "select",
                oms = [OMKey(1,2), OMKey(3,4), OMKey(5,6)])

Python details for experts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There's a gotcha. Python has lists, and it has tuples.  ithon will
convert either to an STL vector when it configures icetray, so this
syntax will work too::

 tray.AddModule("Jeopardy", "j",
   I'll_take="famous_numbers",
   for=500, 
   famous_numbers=(0, 1, 3.14159, 1.618034
   )

here you're implicitly creating a list: notice the parenthesis.  But
if you want to configure a vector with only one entry, it wont work::

   famous_numbers=3.14159

here the parenthesis just disappear and that becomes just a double,
fand you get a "cant convert parameter" error when configuring.  But
tuples stay tuples::

   famous_numbers=[3.14159]

This works, and configures with a vector of length 1 containing pi.
So just use [square brackets].  They mean the same thing and they're
easier to see.

.. _NaN:
.. index:: NaN

.. _Inf:
.. index:: Inf

NaN and Inf
===========

:file:`I3Tray.py` creates namespace-scope variables ``Inf`` and
``Nan``, for the special floating-point values infinity and
not-a-number.  These are for the occasions when one needs to pass NaN
or Inf to a module parameter, or to initialize e.g. an :class:`I3Double <icecube.dataclasses.I3Double>`
to NaN.

``NaN`` compared to anything (including itself) is always false.  To
tell if a variable is nan, or not, use the functions ``isnan`` and
``isinf``.  In python 2.6 and later, these are in module :mod:`math`,
in earlier versions they are in module :mod:`scipy`::

  >>> from I3Tray import NaN, Inf
  >>> NaN
  nan
  >>> Inf
  inf
  >>> NaN == NaN       # You probably do *not* want this
  False
  >>> import math
  >>> math.isnan(NaN)  # You want this
  True
  >>> math.isinf(Inf)
  True
