Icetray
=======

.. note::
   
   Herein, *module* has a couple of meanings.  One is ``I3Module``,
   which is the interface by which one writes plugins/extensions to
   icetray.  *Module* is also used in the sense of a group of python
   extensions, which, to add to the confusion, are more like icetray
   *projects* than icetray *modules*.  Were it possible at this stage
   I would rename the ``I3Module`` variety of module to 'plugin'.

   The use of *module* at the top right hand of this page (next to
   *index*), is in the python-module sense.  It is not supposed to
   take you to a listing of all I3Modules.
