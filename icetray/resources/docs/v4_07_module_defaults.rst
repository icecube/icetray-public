=========================
 Module defaults changed
=========================

The decision has been made to examine several of the defaults used in
key modules and update out-of-date modules.  While this does not
greatly impact offline-software, it could have a greater impact in
projects like icerec and simulation, where defaults once used
may no longer be the same.

If you're trying to run old scripts, and expecting default values from
modules, you'd be advised to carefully check your scripts as you 
update them to the new V4-based releases.
