/**
 * @class I3SingleServiceFactory
 * @author boersma (after an idea by juancarlo)
 *
 * This is a generic factory for services which do not need individual
 * copies for all "users". That is, only one service object gets created
 * per factory object, and it gets put into all contexts.  So it is still
 * possible to have two different service objects of the same class but
 * with different configurations; just define two separate factories
 * with the different configuration parameters in your python script.
 * 
 * The service objects are made available using the second argument of
 * the "AddService" call. That is, with the following python lines you'd
 * create two differently configured service objects, which modules can
 * retrieve and use via the names "room101" and "room102", respectively.
 * 
 * tray.AddService("I3SingleServiceFactory<I3RoomService>","room101")(
 *     ("FridgeContents",["vodka","caviar"]),
 * )
 * tray.AddService("I3SingleServiceFactory<I3RoomService>","room102")(
 *     ("FridgeContents",["yoghurt","granola"]),
 * )
 *
 * To use this factory for a specific service, the service class needs
 * to implement at least an I3Context-using constructor and a Configure()
 * method.
 *
 * MyService::MyService(I3Context&);
 * void MyService::Configure(I3Context&);
 *
 * To facilitate adding and getting parameters to/from the context, you
 * can derive your class from I3ServiceBase, but that's not strictly
 * necessary. The base class defines a few convenience methods. If
 * the service is not happy with what it gets from the configuration,
 * it should call log_fatal during Configure().
 *
 * For the instantiation of the factory class you provide two template
 * parameters. The first should be the service class itself, it is used to
 * to instantiate the service object(s). Many service classes are derived
 * of some other service base classes, e.g. I3EventLogLikelihoodBase. If
 * the service factory should Put() the service object pointer into a
 * context as a pointer-to-base, then you can use the second template
 * argument to specify that base class. The second template argument
 * can also be omitted, by default it is identical to the first template
 * argument.
 *
 * The implementation file of the service class (say "I3RoomSercice") should
 * also contain a line of the form:
 * I3_SERVICE_FACTORY(I3SingleServiceFactory<I3RoomService>)
 *
 * @sa I3MultiServiceFactory, I3ServiceFactory, I3Context, I3Configuration
