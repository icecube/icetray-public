serialization
=============

**Maintainer** : Alex Olivas

This project is a frozen version of boost::serialization (v1.57), where
(for the most part) only the namespace has changed.  boost::serialization
broke for our archive (branched long ago from the 'standard' boost PBA),
in boost version 1.58.
