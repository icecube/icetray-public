Release Notes
=============

trunk
-----

- Add `I3CosmicEventGenerator`, an interface for using CORSIKA as a service in mulitprocess-server clsim

June 20, 2018 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
------------------------------------------------------------------
V01-08-01 - Incremental release

  r161706 - Merged branches/streaming-hit-merging
  r160494 -pybindings for I3CrossSection and add more rigorous kinematic constraints to avoid physically impossible states, avoid neglecting particle masses in more places.
  r159957 - Use a more numerically stable calculation of s. 
  r159909 - Improve DIS final state sampling Get calculation details from spline file

V01-08-00 - Incremental release

* (Kotoyo) Modified pure virtual function I3PropergatorService::Propagate
  Now the Propagate function takes third argument I3FrameConstPtr,
  in order to make I3NeutrinoPropagator work properly.

V01-07-01 - Incremental release

March 24, 2017 Juan Carlos Diaz-Velez (juancarlos@icecube.wisc.edu)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

V01-07-00 - Incremental release

* Added I3PrimaryPulseMapper from sim-services to generate an I3ParticleIDMap that associates MCPulses with
  the primary of the particle that produced them. PMTResponseSimulator adds an I3ParticleIDMap that maps pulses with
  the particle that produced them but often these secondary particles are not saved in order to save space on disc.

V01-06-00 - Bugfix release

* Moved I3MCPEConverters here.  It wasn't used anywhere, but we'll keep it around
  a while longer.  It was previously in simclasses, but didn't belong there. (r138939, r138940, r138941)
* Removed I3ModifyStartTime - This shouldn't be needed. (r137412)
* No longer adding beacon baselines to GCD files.  We're only generating V4
  simulation with DOMLauncher. (r136995)
* Added a default for I3MCPEtoI3MCHitConverter.  I3MCPESeries seems perfectly
  reasonable to me.
* Removed virtual keyword from module methods.  This usually signals to
  users that this is a base class (especially if the destructor is virtual),
  and therefore OK to inherit from.  This is not the case with these modules.
  Do not inherit from classes that were not designed to be base classes.
* Added I3ModifyStartTime as a replacement for I3ModifyEventID.  I3ModifyEventID
  is deprecated.  It modifies more than just the event ID and is actually only
  still used to set the event start time.  The interface was crufty anyway and
  from the days when we could only pass built-in C++ types as python parameters.
* Added I3RemoveLargeDT module to remove outliers that caused simulation
  to use enormous amounts of memory.  Anything outside the time window
  from the median of the distribution is clipped.

V01-05-05 - Bugfix release

* More tests for sanity checkers

November 7, 2014 Alex Olivas (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
-----------------------------------------------------

V01-05-04 - Bugfix release

* New I3DownsampleMCPE class
* I3MCEventHeaderGenerator - Added option to increment the DAQ time.
* Uses I3_TESTDATA instead of I3_PORTS/test-data
* Re-worked hobo test suite.   Not all modules and histograms have tests.
  When all modules and histograms have tests implemented we can enable
  "all_your_tests_are_belong_to_us.py" which checks that they indeed all
  have tests.
* The GCD validation scripts were updated.  One-stop-shop for GCD generation
  is sim-services/resources/gcd_validation/generate_gcd.py.  That does the
  DB pull, correction, testing, and validation.  It also writes the svn info
  and GCD checksum to the output logfile.
* An empty tree checker was added to the sanity checkers.

------------------------------------------------------

V01-05-03 - Bugfix release

* Following matplotlib's recommendations for batch processing of plots.
* I3InIceCORSIKATrimmer - Drop particles that aren't InIce muons or neutrinos.

July 10, 2014 Alex Olivas  (olivas@icecube.umd.edu)
---------------------------------------------------

V01-05-00 - Minor Release - Mostly histogramming stuff.

* Restored HistoDataLiveTime for comparisons to data.
* Added 'event_weight' convenience function.
* Added embedded test suite to force users to write tests for their histograms.
* Added Prescale parameter to the SimulationSanityChecker module.
* Some support for the new 'weighting' project.  More is needed.
* Histogram comparison is included in this release.

Revisions :

More fixes to PropagatorServiceUtils::Propagate.  The copy was not
updated.  The original tree was updated and a pointer to the unadulterated
copy was returned.  In addition to the tree pointer needed to be passed
by reference.  It would have been nice if Alex-of-May-18th included
a simple test along with revision 88449 that tested this.  The current
version ( V01-02-02 ) does include tests for all three flavors.  There
are 6 tests ( two x three for each function and flavor ).

--------------------------------------------------

Revisions : 88449

Fixed PropagatorServiceUtils::Propagate.  MMC can add propagatable
particles as daughters to the original, especially when using AtmFlux.
Since the tree was updated and iterated in-place the daughters would
be propagated, causing an infinite loop.  Now the original tree
is iterated over and a copy is updated.

Going to get serious about release notes for individual projects.
