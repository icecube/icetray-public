# This test is slightly different than those in test_mctree_physics_library
# in that it uses I3MCTreeUtils to add the primary, which sets the shape
# to Primary on the fly.
# There are trees in production where this shape is not set and the methods
# that got the primary would fail when the shape wasn't set.  Currents methods
# don't rely on the shape being set to Primary.
