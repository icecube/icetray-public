Dataclasses documentation
=========================

Dataclasses are the common classes used to describe objects in
IceCube/Icetray.  These classes are the objects exchanged by I3Modules.

This project is maintained by:
* Alex Olivas <olivas@icecube.wisc.edu>
* Don La Dieu <dladieu@icecube.wisc.edu>
* David Schultz <david.schultz@icecube.wisc.edu>

Dataclasses still needs more docs.
