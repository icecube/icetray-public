CompareAsInt.cpp - various functions to compare floating point numbers using
integer operations, other functions to test these comparisons, and other
functions to print out floating point numbers and their representation.
This comes from here : http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm
We'll see this a lot below so I'll include a snippet from the website.

The IEEE float and double formats were designed so that the numbers are lexicographically ordered√¢,
which in the words of IEEE architect William Kahan means "if two floating-point numbers in the same 
format are ordered ( say x < y ), then they are ordered the same way when their bits are reinterpreted 
as Sign-Magnitude integers."
 
This means that if we take two floats in memory, interpret their bit pattern as integers, and compare 
them, we can tell which is larger, without doing a floating point comparison. In the C/C++ language 
this comparison looks like this:

if (*(int*)&f1 < *(int*)&f2)

This charming syntax means take the address of f1, treat it as an integer pointer, and dereference it. 
All those pointer operations look expensive, but they basically all cancel out and just mean "treat f1 
as an integer". Since we apply the same syntax to f2 the whole line means compare f1 and f2, 
using their in-memory representations interpreted as integers instead of floats.

NB:  Another thing you'll see is "Ulps" which stands for "Units in the Last Place."
