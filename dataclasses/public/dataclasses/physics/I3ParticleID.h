/**
 * @brief A single object for holding the ID numbers of an I3Particle
 *
 * In icetray, the "ID" of a particle object is a pair of (integer) numbers that
 * serve as its unique identifier.  No two particles, even two particles in
 * different data sets, can have the same identifier.  This is important because
 * simulation is not done in one single process, but instead in stages, where
 * particle generation and propagation can happen on different machines.  So if
 * we simply assigned '0' to the first particle created in a generator process,
 * its ID would clash with the first particle created by the propagator, both of
 * which will be added to the same I3MCTree.
 */

  /**
   * This is a hash of the time (of I3Particle object creation),
   * process ID, and hostname.  So two particles created at the same
   * time on the same machine, but in different processes will have
   * different major IDs.

   * clang seems to be smart enough to know these aren't used 
   * uninitialized, so we only turn them off for gcc, since
   * this just causes more clang warnings.
